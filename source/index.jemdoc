== About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of [http://ee.stanford.edu Electrical 
Engineering] at [http://www.stanford.edu Stanford University], where I study
retinal prostheses for sight restoration in people suffering from 
degenerative diseases of the retina, such as 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa retinitis pigmentosa]  or 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration age-related macular 
degeneration]. I am part of the [http://www.stanford.edu/~palanker Palanker lab]
at Stanford and also work in close collaboration with the 
[http://biomedical.ucsc.edu/Sher.html Sher lab] at UCSC. 
The Stanford photovoltaic retinal implant is now being developped in 
collaboration with [http://www.pixium-vision.com/ Pixium Vision], a start-up
company based at the [http://www.institut-vision.org/ Vision Institute] in
Paris, France.

Prior to Stanford, I obtained a diplôme d'ingénieur from [http://www.ecp.fr/ 
Ecole Centrale Paris, France], where my focus was on Applied Mathematics.
